title: learning as an adult
---

When I set out to become a full software developer I knew I would face many hurdles.  I wasn't good at math in school and anything beyond instilling software on a windows machine seemed like voodoo to me.  Despite these obvious shortcomings, I am hard headed and willing to fail multiple times to learn something the correct way.  I figured these two characteristics would be able to work together and balance each other out.  The one thing I did not plan for was how different learning as an adult is in comparison to learning as a teen.

In high school and college, I was the kind of student who never had to study.  I showed up to lectures and reviewed my notes between classes and I would manage solid B's and C's.  When I started to re-educate myself and learn web development I found this to be very different from how I now learn and absorb information.  As I learned new techniques and languages I would find myself jumping right into using them after not reviewing the concepts first.  This style is not without its benefits as it forces you to experiment but for myself, it often becomes more frustrating than enlightening.  If you have ever tried to learn new things while frustrated then you will see the conundrum.

I had to go back and reevaluate the way I was learning and using the information I was being presented.

I'm the kind of person who plans their whole day out hour by hour.  I understand this is not the lifestyle for everyone but for me it's effective.  I set aside large amounts of time for web development but I have also started working in reviews of web development throughout the day.  If I have 2 hours set aside for physical activity I now work in a half hour review of things I'll be working with during the time I have set aside for web development.  When I get to the time I have set aside for web development I can then get to the actual development part much faster and the information has already been reviewed.

This is not a cure-all solution for learning as an adult.  If you have creepy strong time management abilities (that border on mental health illness) then I would strongly recommend it if you struggle with learning new ideas.
