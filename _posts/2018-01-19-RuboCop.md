If you're a Ruby developer and want to keep up with your best practices Rubocop is a simple no hassle way to do so.  You have other options for Ruby linters but if you're like me you also have a love of cheesy 80s movies then any opportunity to indulge in code liniting and 80s movie nostalgia is not to be missed.

Rubocop gives you the ability to clearn up your code and enforec some best partices automattily by running an auto correct.
