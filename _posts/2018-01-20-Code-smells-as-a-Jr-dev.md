title: Code smells as a Jr Dev: or how I learned to stop worrying and love the testing (and a great talk from Sandi Mets)

As a junior level developer coming out of a boot camp I will admit that I had no idea what code smell was.  I do think boot camps are great but I also realize that this is a lot of information to cover in a short amount of time so things like this may not come up.  I knew that testing was important but was a bit intimidated by the things I was already learning.  I felt like just writing code that worked was itself a great success (I still do) but would find myself with no idea of how to start to refactor.

After hearing this talk from Sandi Metz I feel a lot better about refactoring and I fully understand the importance of writing tests.

Even a basic understanding of code smells makes it clear how to start the refactoring process and with the information she provides finding solutions also becomes clear.  Having a clear starting point makes refactoring much less nerve-racking and leads to the importance of testing.  If you cant make sure your refactors arent breaking your code why would you do them?  Whats worse than bloated code that runs slow?  Code that breaks and fails.  Why have either if you can spend a little more time?
