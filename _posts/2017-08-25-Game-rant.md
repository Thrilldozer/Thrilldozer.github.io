I just want to start by saying, Im, a PC gamer.  My rig is an AMD FX-8350 8 core processor, 16 gigs of RAM and a Nvidia 1070 Asus GPU.

As I've aged I've come to enjoy different aspects of video games.  I've become a hardcore casual gamer.  I really like games I can pick up and play for 15 to 30 minutes and when done feel like I've had an experience.  This is a new phase in my life as a gamer.  In my youth, I would sit for hours breeding chocobos because "DAMN IT I NEEDED A GOLDEN ONE!".  A hundred hours of gameplay would be a welcome week or two of my life.  Now a single player game with over 20 hours makes me wince.  The last "long" game I finished was the Witcher 3 and it was amazing, but  I had to drag myself through it.

I first noticed the change when I stopped playing World of Warcraft years ago.  The guild I was working with had hit a wall and could not advance due to lack of gear and skill.  None of this was my fault in any way as I was a main tank and super hardcore I assure you.  So I did the only normal thing a rock star tank would do, I rolled a druid healer and went into PVP.  I managed to rank a bit over 1700 in ranked 2v2 with random players (nothing amazing but not bad).  I really liked playing against other people because every match was something new.  The replay value was endless and fast.  The only downside to the PVP was the slow gear progression.  Over time I lost all lust for WoW and would cancel my account but the want for fast-paced gameplay and replay value remained.

I'm not very excited by first-person shooters as a genre.  I play them and like them but they aren't something I've ever been very good at.  When Blizzard launched Over Watch as a Blizzard fanboi I decided to give it a chance(I had not played TF2).  OverWatch very quickly scratched my itch for fast paced skill based teamwork gameplay.

A year or so later Friday the 13th was released and as a fan of the movies, I had to have the game.  I really do like the game but, to be honest, it's not [not the best game ever](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game).  But the for people who liked the movies the game does deliver on feeling the movies have and met my casual gamer needs.

After giving Friday the 13th a chance I also decided to play Dead by Daylight.  I was surprised by how much I liked this game.  It has a very stiff learning curb but once you get it down its very fun.

The theme I keep noticing is the games I'm liking more are using less and less AI.  I think that the future of casual games is in the removal of AI and allowing humans to make the experience they will have.  I would imagine from a developers point of view this would be great in some ways.  You don't have to worry about developing AI but I would also imagine that testing gameplay to make sure things are balanced would take even longer.
