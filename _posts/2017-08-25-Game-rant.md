I just want to start by saying Im a PC gamer.  My rig is an AMD FX-8350 8 core processor, 16 gigs of RAM and a Nvidia 1070 Asus GPU.

As Ive aged Ive come to enjoy different aspects of video games.  Ive become a hardcore casual gamer.  I really like games I can pick up and play for 15 to 30 minuets and when done feel like Ive had an expirence.  This is a new phase in my life as a gamer.  In my youth I would sit for hours breeding chocobos because "DAMN IT I NEEDED A GOLDNE ONE!".  A hundred hours of game play would be a welcome week or two of my life.  Now a single player game with over 20 hours makes me wince.  The last "long" game I finished was the Witcher 3 and it was amazing, but  I had to drag myself through it.  

I first noticed the change when I stopped playing World of War craft years ago.  The guild I was working with had hit a wall and could not advance due to lack of gear and skill.  None of this was my fault in any way as I was a main tank and super hard core I assure you.  So I did the only normal thing a rock star tank would do, I rolled a druid healer and went into PVP.  I managed to rank a bit over 1700 in ranked 2v2 with random players (nothing amazing but not bad).  I really liked playing against other people because every match was something new.  The replay value was endless and fast.  The only down side to the PVP was the slow gear progression.  Over time I lost all lust for WoW and would cancel my account but the want for fast paced game play and replay value remained.

Im not very excited by first person shooters as a genre.  I play them and like them but they arent something Ive every been very good at.  When Blizzard launched Over Watch as a Blizzard fan boi I decided to give it a chance(I had not played TF2).  Over Watch very quickly scratched my itch for fast paced skill based team work game play.   

A year or so later Friday the 13th was released and as a fan of the movies I had to have the game.  I really do like the game but to be honest its not [not the best game ever](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game).  But the for people who liked the movies the game does deliver on feeling the movies have and met my casual gamer needs.

After giving Friday the 13th a chance I also decided to play Dead by Daylight.  I was surprised by how much I liked this game.  It has a very stiff learning curb but once you get it down its very fun.  

The theme I keep noticing is the games Im liking more are using less and less AI.  I think that the future of casual games is in removal of AI and allowing humans to make the experience they will have.  I would imagine from a developers point of view this would be great in some ways.  You dont have to worry about developing AI but I would also imagine that testing game play to make sure things are balanced would take even longer.
