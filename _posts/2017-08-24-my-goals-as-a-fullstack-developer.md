title: My goals as a full stack web developer
---

My goals as a full stack web developer are modest in scope.  I want to be a part of an industry that I believe is the future and that rewards work done over connections made. I want the opportunities to attempt to carve a career for myself and will push me to become better.  I dont have any aim for an industry yet and I would be happy to take almost any opportunity I could.  I understand that each job has value as it will teach me new ways of developing and working.  In turn I bring completely new ideas and prospective to a work environment as I do not have years of expirecne and bad habbits already ground into my head.  

I wanted to become a full stack web developer so I could have a better understanding of web development as a whole.  Im sure as I go a long and learn more I will develop tastes for different languages and frame works.

I enjoy the possible mobility of being a full stack web developer.  I have lived out of country before in Europe and having a skill like web development can make applying for a work visa much easier.  The flexibility of hours that can be found in this industry are also very appealing to me.  The ability to receive prestige world wide is something we should all strive for.

The main goal I have in becoming a full stack web developer is to allow myself financial freedom in learning a skill that will be in demand for many decades to come.  It is an amazing bonus that web development and computer sciences are very interesting and something I can do for a living without becoming board.
