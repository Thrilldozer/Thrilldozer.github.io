title: My goals as a software developer
---

My goals as a software developer are modest in scope.  I want to be a part of an industry that I believe is the future and that rewards work done over connections made. I want the opportunities to attempt to carve a career for myself.  I don't have any aim for an industry yet and I would be happy to take almost any opportunity I could.  I understand that each job has value as it will teach me new ways of developing and working.  In turn, I bring completely new ideas and perspective to a work environment as I do not have years of experience and bad habits already ground into my head.

I wanted to become a software developer so I could have a better understanding of web development as a whole.  I'm sure as I go along and learn more I will develop tastes for different languages and frameworks.

I enjoy the possible mobility of being a full software developer.  I have lived out of the country before in Europe and having a skill like a web developer can make applying for a work visa much easier.  The flexibility of hours that can be found in this industry is also very appealing to me.  The ability to receive prestige worldwide is something we should all strive for.

The main goal I have in becoming a software developer is to allow myself financial freedom in learning a skill that will be in demand for many decades to come.  It is an amazing bonus that software development and computer sciences are very interesting and something I can do for a living without becoming bored.
